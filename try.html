    <h1>Homework 2</h1>
    <p> This homework was based on using html and css. We had to do a home page and a sitemap where there were links for the other pages.
        The main page is containing links fot the sitemap and 3 other pages.Each of the 3 pages contain a form  
        acting as a web interface for the web service http://www.random.org/.
        In order to correct the html and css files a validator was used.
    </p>
