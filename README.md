# E-learning Platform 
# Overview
Education is the key to personal growth. E-learning is the way in which knowledge and skills are put together in an online format.What I want is to offer a safe space for students to develop their work, to keep up with the progress. For now, the e-learning is offering 4 computer-science courses.The package consists in: "Python Beginners Course", "Java Beginners Course","Cyber Security Course","Web Development". All these are logically structured in chapters. After finishing one chapter the progress bar will increase, such that is a way of motivating the students into learning. Teachers are the tool to increase the receptiveness of a lesson for students.
