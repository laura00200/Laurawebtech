# E-learning Platform 
# Overview
Education is the key to personal growth. E-learning is the way in which knowledge and skills are put together in an online format.What I want is to offer a safe space for students to develop their work, to keep up with the progress. For now, the e-learning is offering 4 computer-science courses.The package consists in: "Python Beginners Course", "Java Beginners Course","Cyber Security Course","Web Development". All these are logically structured in chapters. After finishing one chapter the progress bar will increase, such that is a way of motivating the students into learning. Teachers are the tool to increase the receptiveness of a lesson for students.

### Installation 
The tools mentioned below can simplify the process of working with sample code:

1) Visual Studio Code

In order for me to start the creation of the project I had to install Visual Studio Code. It is open source and it has a lot of extentions, easy to use.
```bash
https://code.visualstudio.com/download
```
Once i done that I started step by step to create files that were a necessity for my project.

2) Github
Used for managing the project


## UI DESIGN
For the Ui design I used HTML and CSS.HTML was used for structuring the content of the webpage and CSS for the style and the visual presentation.I wanted to mostly create an easy to use interface in order to target the audience, which are the students.
